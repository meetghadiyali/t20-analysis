# T20 Cricket Game Analysis

* Analysis the Indian Cricket Team's 2018 and 2019 International 20-over Cricket matches. 
* Used a different approach of analyzing commentary (word descriptions) instead of plain numerical data. 
* Plot graphs to answer various questions pertaning to the matches and made the appropriate intferences. 
* Used Jupyter Notebook for the analysis. 


# Why using commentary (word description of the game) instead of numerical data as input? 

* Commentary about the game gives lot of interesting insights otther than the usual runs and wickets. 


* This was a desciptive sports analysis.
* I summarized the sports data to come up with important statistics.
