That was clipped away towards fine leg after a hop across the sticks. And if the shot was not iffy, the running was shody. Both the batters wanted a mid-pitch handshake it seems and all that Dhoni did was collect the throw from the deep and disturb the sticks at the batter's end. Dhoni did not know about the whereabouts of either batter and just as a matter of caution threw the ball to the bowler, who also took a bail off. But no double play is allowed, of course. <b>D Arcy Short run out (Krunal Pandya/Dhoni) 37(37) [4s-5]</b>",101.0,ind-vs-aus-1st-t20i-australia-tour-of-india-2019,2019,U Yadav to Handscomb,U Yadav , Handscomb,2,1.0,aus,ind,2,out

2.6,"Chahar to Lewis, 2 runs, that was in the air for a while, but it falls in no man's land. Short of a length delivery by Chahar, Lewis slaps it over the bowler's head with a flat-bat, but it drops between deep mid-off and deep mid-on. Chahal flicks it back to his partner, and although it's a relay throw, the batsmen take two",22.0,ind-vs-wi-2nd-t20i-west-indies-tour-of-india-2019,2019,Chahar to Lewis,Chahar , Lewis,2,2.0,wi,ind,2,runs
